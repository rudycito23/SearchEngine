# Spring 2022_Data Structures - Final Project
# Search Engine

## Important:

Deadline for the project was approximately 4 weeks.

Our final project in Data Structures was to build a search engine
for a large collection of financial news articles from Jan - May 2018.

The search engine architecture consists of the following:
- Document parser/processor
- Query processor
- Search processor
- Ranking processor

User's query <--> Query Processor
Query Engine <--> Index Handler
Index Handler <--> Index
Document Parser <--> Index Handler
